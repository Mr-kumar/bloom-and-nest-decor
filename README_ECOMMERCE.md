## 🐛 Known Issues

### TypeScript Errors (Expected)
You'll see TypeScript errors about new tables not existing in Supabase types. These will **automatically resolve** after:
1. Applying the database migration
2. Restarting your dev server

The code is correct - TypeScript just needs updated types from Supabase.
